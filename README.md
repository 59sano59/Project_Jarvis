My own version of JARVIS from IronMan movies

I tried to built my own version of Tony Stark's JARVIS A.I from IronMan movies.
Now it can open youtube and facebook, play music, do web searches and search information from wikipideia 
with voice commands also it can set alarms.
Project is still going and now I have been working with neural network and deep learning.
I have used tensorfow 2.0 in my project and try to find best way to teach it to speak and recognize voices.
Now the code uses routes trough my own pc to open google chrome and workin with other functions.
I also made a small controll panel wich can start this JARVIS also.
For that I used QtDesigner (photos and gifs used in code are not added in GitHub).

The idea with this is to 3d print IronMan helmet with moving parts and put this JARVIS to control it.
